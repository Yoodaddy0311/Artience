# Positioning Template

**Core Formula**: "For [audience] who [pain], [product] is a [category] that [benefit]. Unlike [competitor], we [differentiator]."

Build defensible market position by clearly articulating audience, problem, solution, category, and competitive advantage.

## Positioning Statement Elements

| Element | Definition | Example | Common Mistakes |
|---------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| **[audience]** | Specific buyer persona, not "everyone" | Startups raising Series A | Vague ("businesses"), too broad |
| **[pain]** | Concrete problem, quantified if possible | Need to hire fast but can't evaluate engineers | Generic ("want better tools") |
| **[product]** | Product name or category | Artibot | Describing multiple products |
| **[category]** | Market category for context | Agent orchestration platform | New/undefined categories confuse buyers |
| **[benefit]** | Outcome user achieves, not features | Deploy teams of AI agents in hours not weeks | Feature-focused ("has APIs") |
| **[competitor]** | Direct alternative buyer would consider | Manual team coordination scripts | Weak or irrelevant comparisons |
| **[differentiator]** | Unique capability competitor lacks | Native Agent Teams API with zero runtime dependencies | Sustainable and defensible | Marginal/easily copied advantages |

## Porter's Five Forces Competitive Analysis

| Force | Questions | Strategic Implications |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Threat of New Entrants** | Barriers to entry? Capital requirements? IP protection? | High barriers = defensible positioning; Low barriers = focus on scale/brand |
| **Bargaining Power of Suppliers** | How dependent on key vendors? Switching costs? | Diversify suppliers if high power; Premium pricing if trapped |
| **Bargaining Power of Buyers** | Price sensitivity? Switching costs? Buyer concentration? | Low switching costs = emphasize loyalty/ecosystem; Concentrated buyers = enterprise sales needed |
| **Threat of Substitutes** | Alternative solutions to customer problem? | Position against substitutes, not just direct competitors |
| **Competitive Rivalry** | Market concentration? Differentiation? Exit barriers? | Crowded markets = niche positioning; Fragmented = consolidation opportunity |
