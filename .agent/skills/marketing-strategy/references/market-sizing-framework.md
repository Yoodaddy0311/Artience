# Market Sizing Framework

**TAM → SAM → SOM**: Progressively narrow addressable market from total available market to serviceable obtainable market for realistic revenue projections.

## Three-Tier Market Definition

| Tier | Definition | Method | Data Sources | Formula |
|------|-----------|--------|--------------|---------|
| **TAM** (Total Available Market) | Entire market opportunity if 100% penetration | Bottom-up: Avg revenue per user × estimated users; Top-down: Industry analyst reports | Gartner, IDC, government census, industry surveys | (Total population in category) × (Annual spend/user) |
| **SAM** (Serviceable Available Market) | Market segment you can realistically reach with product/go-to-market | Segment selection by geography, vertical, buyer type | Competitor analysis, sales research, regional data | (TAM) × (addressable segment %) |
| **SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable Market) | Market share realistic for first 3-5 years based on execution | Historical growth rates of comparable companies, sales capacity, budget | Sales pipeline, conversion benchmarks, competitive win rates | (SAM) × (Year 1-3 market share target %) |

## Budget Allocation by Growth Stage

| Tier | Budget Range | Allocation | Typical Spend | Metrics Focus |
|------|--------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
