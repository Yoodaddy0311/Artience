# Content Quality Scoring Matrix

**Measure content quality objectively: Use scoring matrix to identify gaps before publishing. Higher scores rank better and generate more traffic.**

## Quality Score Formula

```
Total Score = (Comprehensiveness × 0.20) + (Uniqueness × 0.20) + (Accuracy × 0.20) + (Readability × 0.15) + (Engagement × 0.15) + (Actionability × 0.10)
```
