## Data Narrative Techniques

| Technique | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Lead with Insight** | Start with the "so what", not the data | "Revenue grew 23%, driven by email campaign" not "Revenue was $1.2M" |
| **Compare to Context** | Benchmark against target, period, industry | "CTR 3.2% vs 2.1% industry avg (+52%)" |
| **Explain the Why** | Root cause after every metric | "Bounce rate spiked due to mobile load time regression" |
| **Quantify Impact** | Translate metrics to business outcomes | "Form optimization added ~$45K pipeline/month" |
| **Flag Anomalies** | Call out unusual patterns explicitly | "Tuesday traffic 3x normal — likely viral LinkedIn post" |

| Audience | Format | Frequency | Delivery | Detail Level |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|

## Checklist

- [ ] Executive summary stands alone (readable without rest of report)
- [ ] Every metric has: current value, target, delta, trend, status
- [ ] Insights separated from data (don't bury "so what" in charts)
- [ ] Recommendations have owner, timeline, expected impact
- [ ] Consistent formatting: same chart types, color coding, terminology
- [ ] Report length matches audience (C-suite: 1 page, team: full)
- [ ] All data sources cited and methodology documented
- [ ] Proofread: no conflicting numbers between sections
