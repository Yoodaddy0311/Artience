# Journey Map Template

**Core Principle: Understand Customer Emotions to Design Better Experiences**

A journey map visualizes customer experience across all touchpoints. It reveals emotional highs and lows, pain points, and opportunities for improvement. Use this template to map any stage or complete journey.

## Journey Map Structure

### 1. Goal & Context
- **Journey Title**: Stage or scenario being mapped
- **Persona**: Specific customer segment
- **Timeline**: Hours, days, weeks (what timeframe?)
- **Context**: Business context and background

### 2. Touchpoint Timeline

| Phase | Touchpoint | Action | Channel | Duration | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| **1** | First interaction | Search for solution | Google | 15 min | Need → Awareness |
| **2** | Landing page | Review options | Website | 5 min | Awareness → Interest |
| **3** | Product tour | Watch demo | Email link | 20 min | Interest → Consideration |
| **4** | Trial signup | Create account | Website | 10 min | Consideration → Testing |
| **5** | Onboarding email | Read getting started | Email | 5 min | Testing → Setup |
| **6** | First use | Complete tutorial | Product | 30 min | Setup → Usage |
| **7** | Feature discovery | Explore advanced features | Product | 15 min | Usage → Adoption |

### 3. Customer Experience Mapping

For each touchpoint, assess:

| Touchpoint | Thoughts | Emotions | Pain Points | Opportunities |
|-----------|----------|----------|------------|----------------|
| **Landing page** | "Does this solve my problem?" | Skeptical, curious | Unclear value, slow load | Clear differentiation above fold |
| **Product tour** | "Can I actually use this?" | Interested, overwhelmed | Too many features | Highlight core 3 features only |
| **Trial signup** | "Is this worth my email?" | Cautious | Friction in form | One-click signup with OAuth |
| **Onboarding** | "Where do I start?" | Confused, motivated | Too many options | Guided path, progressive disclosure |
| **First feature use** | "Did I do that right?" | Uncertain, hopeful | Unclear success state | Celebrate aha moment |
| **Advanced features** | "Is there more I can do?" | Empowered, curious | Hidden features | In-app discovery prompts |

### 4. Moment of Truth Analysis

| Moment Type | Trigger | Impact | Current Experience | Ideal Experience | Gap |
|-------------|---------|--------|------------------|-----------------|-----|
| **First Impression** | Lands on site | High churn if poor | Generic hero section | Clear value + social proof | Redesign above-fold |
| **Aha Moment** | First feature use | Drives adoption | Unclear success state | Celebration + next step | Add success animation |
| **Habit Moment** | 7-day engagement | Retention predictor | No email encouragement | Milestone celebration | Add day-7 email |
| **Pain Moment** | Encounters error | Churn risk | Generic error message | Helpful suggestion + support | Add AI-powered help |
| **Delight Moment** | Discovers power user feature | Advocacy trigger | Feature hidden deep | Featured in email | Add discovery flow |

## Quick Journey Audit

Use this 5-min audit to identify quick wins:

1. **Find the biggest emotional drop**: Which touchpoint causes most friction?
2. **Identify the aha moment**: When does customer first recognize value?
3. **Spot the handoff problems**: Where does experience break between teams?
4. **Find the missing touchpoint**: What should be there but isn't?
5. **Spot the delight gap**: Where could you exceed expectations?

Address top 2-3 issues before full redesign.
