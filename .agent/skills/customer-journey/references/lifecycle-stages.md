# Lifecycle Stages

**Core Principle: Map Every Customer Interaction to Revenue Impact**

The customer lifecycle has seven distinct stages. Each stage has unique goals, success metrics, and required touchpoints. Mapping your customer journey to these stages enables targeted content, automations, and team accountability.

## Lifecycle Stage Definitions

| Stage | Definition | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria | Primary Goal | KPI |
|-------|-----------|----------------|---------------|-------------|-----|

| **Consideration** | Customer evaluates options | Engages with content | Sales discussion | Prove differentiation | Content engagement, time |
| **Decision** | Customer chooses you | Sales conversation | Deal closed | Win deal | Win rate, sales cycle |
| **Onboarding** | Customer sets up product | Account created | Feature usage begins | Activate quickly | Time to first action |
| **Adoption** | Customer uses regularly | Active feature use | Regular engagement | Drive retention | Feature adoption rate |
| **Expansion** | Customer grows usage | Uses advanced features | Upsell discussion | Increase revenue | Expansion revenue |

**Decision → Onboarding**: Welcome email series, success manager assignment, calendar booking
**Onboarding → Adoption**: Feature adoption emails, tip sequences, usage milestone celebrations
**Adoption → Expansion**: Upsell emails (when usage thresholds hit), ROI recalculation, tier upgrade
**Expansion → Advocacy**: Feedback request after 3mo, case study invitation, referral program enrollment
**Advocacy**: Ambassador recruitment, exclusive community access, co-marketing opportunities

## Lifecycle Health Scoring

Calculate customer health to predict churn and expansion:

| Signal | Positive (5 pts) | Neutral (3 pts) | Negative (1 pt) |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Engagement** | Daily active use | Weekly use | <1x monthly |
| **Support** | Self-service, positive | Occasional tickets | Frequent complaints |
| **Expansion** | Upgrading tier | Stable tier | Tier downgrade |
| **NPS** | 50+ promoter | 30-49 passive | <30 detractor |
| **Payment** | Auto-renew, on-time | Requires reminder | Late/failed payment |

**Score >20 = Growth opportunity, <10 = Churn risk**
