# Keyword Priority Formula

**Prioritize data-driven keyword selection: Use formula to rank opportunities by impact and achievability, not gut instinct.**

## Priority Score Formula

```
Score = (Volume × 0.25) + ((100 - Difficulty) × 0.25) + (Relevance × 0.30) + (Intent × 0.20)
```

| Factor | Weight | Scoring (1-10) | How to Measure |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Search Volume** | 0.25 (25%) | 10 = 10k+/month, 1 = <100/month | SEMrush, Ahrefs, Google Keyword Planner |
| **Keyword Difficulty** | 0.25 (25%) | Inverted: 10 = easy (10-20 KD), 1 = hard (80-100 KD) | SEMrush KD score (0-100, invert to 1-10) |
| **Relevance** | 0.30 (30%) | 10 = perfect match, 5 = partial, 1 = off-topic | Does keyword align with target service/content? |
| **Intent Match** | 0.20 (20%) | 10 = transactional, 8 = commercial, 5 = navigational, 3 = informational | See search-intent-classification.md |

## Priority Tiers (Score Range)

| Tier | Score Range | Strategy | Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Quick Win** | 8.0-10.0 | Attack first (high volume + low competition) | 1-3 months |
| **Growth** | 6.0-7.9 | Build secondary traffic (balanced opportunity) | 3-6 months |
| **Long-term** | 4.0-5.9 | Authority building (builds topical dominance) | 6-12 months |
| **Monitor** | <4.0 | Skip or revisit (low ROI) | Review quarterly |

## Calculation Example

Keyword: "sustainable packaging options"
- Volume: 8,500/month → Score: 9
- Difficulty: 42 → (100-42) = 58 → Score: 5.8 → 6
- Relevance: Perfect match → Score: 10
- Intent: Commercial (comparison) → Score: 8

**Final Score: (9 × 0.25) + (6 × 0.25) + (10 × 0.30) + (8 × 0.20) = 2.25 + 1.5 + 3.0 + 1.6 = 8.35 → Quick Win**
