# Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) Guide

**Optimize for AI-powered search: GEO focuses on answering questions directly, not just ranking for keywords. AI engines reward comprehensive, verifiable, high-authority content.**

## GEO vs Traditional SEO Comparison

| Factor | Traditional SEO | GEO Approach | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Content Goal** | Rank in Google SERPs | Answer in AI outputs (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini) | Very High |
| **Key Signal** | Backlinks, keyword density | Entity coverage, comprehensiveness, authority | High |
| **Citation Requirement** | Links as votes | Direct citations with URL in response | Very High |
| **Content Structure** | H1-H6 hierarchy, meta tags | Structured data, definitions, statistics | High |
| **Depth Requirement** | 2,000+ words (typical) | 3,000-5,000+ words (answer all questions) | High |
| **Authority Proof** | Domain authority score | Author credentials, publication history, expertise | Very High |

## GEO Core Principles

1. **Answer-First Content**: Write to answer the full question, not to rank
2. **Entity Clarity**: Define your industry, products, and expertise clearly (Schema markup)
3. **Citation-Worthy**: Be so authoritative AI engines want to cite you
4. **Comprehensive**: Cover all angles; partial answers get ignored
5. **Verifiable**: Include statistics, studies, data with sources
