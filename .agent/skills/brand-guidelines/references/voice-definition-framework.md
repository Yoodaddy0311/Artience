# Voice Definition Framework

**Core Principle: Voice = Personality × Tone × Language**

Your brand voice is a consistent identity across all touchpoints. It combines what you are (personality), how you say it (tone), and which words you use (language). This framework helps you define, calibrate, and apply voice systematically.

## Voice Dimensions

| Dimension | Formal ← → | Casual | Definition | When to Use |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Formality** | Formal, professional | Conversational, relaxed | Level of professionalism and structure | Professional services: Formal; Consumer brands: Casual |
| **Seriousness** | Serious, authoritative | Playful, humorous | Emotional tone and gravity | Financial/legal: Serious; Entertainment: Playful |
| **Technical** | Technical, specialized | Simple, accessible | Complexity of language and jargon | Developer platforms: Technical; Mass market: Simple |
| **Authority** | Authoritative, directive | Approachable, collaborative | Level of expertise positioning | Enterprise: Authoritative; Community: Approachable |
| **Emotion** | Reserved, corporate | Warm, personal | Emotional connection level | B2B: Reserved; B2C: Warm |

## Voice Personality Profile

Define your brand in 3-5 core traits (adjectives):
- Primary trait: What you're known for
- Secondary traits: Supporting characteristics
- Avoid trait: What you explicitly reject
- Emotional target: How audience should feel

Example: "Expert, approachable, efficient, trustworthy, (not condescending)"
