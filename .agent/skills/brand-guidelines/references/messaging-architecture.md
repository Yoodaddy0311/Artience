# Messaging Architecture

**Core Principle: Brand Promise → Value Propositions → Proof Points**

Messaging architecture creates a hierarchy from your highest-level commitment down to specific claims. This structure ensures consistency, prevents contradictions, and helps every team member understand what to communicate.

## Messaging Hierarchy

| Layer | Purpose | Length | Frequency | Example |
|-------|---------|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Brand Promise** | Core commitment to customers | 1 sentence | Every communication | "We make shipping software faster and safer" |
| **Value Propositions** | 3-5 unique benefits | 1 phrase each | Every marketing piece | Speed, Safety, Simplicity, Reliability, Scale |
| **Proof Points** | Evidence backing each value | 1-2 sentences | Sales, case studies | "50% faster than competitors (IDC study 2025)" |
| **Supporting Claims** | Feature benefits | 1-2 sentences | Product copy, ads | "AI code review catches 95% of bugs before merge" |
| **Tactical Messages** | Specific campaign angles | 1-2 sentences | Campaigns, CTAs | "Ship with confidence: 30-day free trial" |

## Messaging by Audience Segment

| Segment | Primary Value | Secondary Value | Proof Point | Messaging Tone |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| **Developers** | Speed, DX | Learning, community | "Dev time ↓ 40%" | Technical, credible |
| **Engineering Leads** | Risk reduction, scale | Team velocity, insights | "1 critical bug caught/mo avg" | Data-driven, strategic |
| **Executives** | Cost savings, ROI | Competitive advantage | "$2.1M saved annually" | Business outcomes, efficiency |
| **End Users** | Reliability, experience | Simplicity, control | "99.99% uptime" | Reassuring, clear |
| **New Users** | Ease of onboarding | Time-to-value | "Running in 5 minutes" | Encouraging, friendly |

## Message Testing Framework

Test every message for clarity, believability, and differentiation:

| Test | Question | Pass Criteria | Fix If |
|------|----------|---------------|--------|
| **Clarity** | Can a new user explain this in their own words? | 90%+ can restate accurately | Jargon, unclear benefit |
| **Credibility** | Does the audience believe this claim? | 85%+ rate as believable | Overstatement, vagueness |
| **Differentiation** | Does this explain why us, not competitors? | Unique angle present | Generic benefit statement |
| **Relevance** | Does this matter to this segment? | 80%+ rate as important | Wrong audience, wrong value |
| **Action** | Does this motivate next step? | CTR/conversion lift | Unclear CTA, weak incentive |

## Writing Rules Checklist

- [ ] Use active voice (subject + verb + object)
- [ ] Lead with benefit, not feature ("Save time" not "Real-time processing")
- [ ] Use specific metrics ("50% faster" not "much faster")
- [ ] Avoid weasel words (just, really, very, actually, literally)
- [ ] One idea per sentence
- [ ] Prove claims with evidence or remove
- [ ] Use second-person perspective ("you") strategically
- [ ] Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- [ ] Include stakeholder in message (how does this help THEM?)
- [ ] Eliminate redundancy between headline and body

## Message Architecture Review

**Every message deck should include:**
- [ ] Brand promise (visible, centered)
- [ ] 3-5 value propositions clearly distinguished
- [ ] Proof point per value proposition
- [ ] Audience segment for each message cluster
- [ ] Evidence sources for all claims
- [ ] CTA aligned to promise and audience
- [ ] Brand voice consistent across all levels
- [ ] No contradictions between layers
- [ ] Competitive differentiation clear
