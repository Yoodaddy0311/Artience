# Competitor Analysis Framework

**Tiered Competitor Assessment**: 4 tiers (Direct, Indirect, Aspirational, Emerging) with depth and frequency matched to strategic relevance for accurate competitive positioning.

## Competitor Tier Classification

| Tier | Definition | Analysis Depth | Update Frequency | Example | Strategic Response |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Direct** | Compete for same customers with similar solutions | Deep: product roadmap, pricing, messaging, win/loss, sales strategy | Weekly or real-time | Zapier vs. Make (automation platforms) | Urgent: features, positioning, pricing power |
| **Indirect** | Solve same problem with different approach or category | Medium: product comparison, positioning, market presence | Monthly | Slack vs. Teams (communication, not direct) | Moderate: differentiation, ecosystem |
| **Aspirational** | Companies we want to become (larger, different market) | Light: business model, go-to-market, brand presence | Quarterly | Stripe (payments) aspiring to become payments OS | Inspirational: long-term roadmap, culture |
| **Emerging** | New entrants gaining traction, may become direct | Medium: product direction, funding, traction velocity | Bi-weekly | Early-stage AI agent startups in 2026 | Watch: monitor signal, prepare response |

## SWOT Analysis with Strategic Implications

| Dimension | Analysis Process | Strategic Questions | Output Use |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Strengths** | What do competitors excel at? Barriers to replication? | Can we defend against this? Must we match or differentiate? | Identifies positioning gaps, focus areas |
| **Weaknesses** | What are customer pain points with competitor? Unmet needs? | Can we exploit this in messaging? Is this sustainable? | Defines differentiation angles, messaging |
| **Opportunities** | Market shifts favoring us? Competitor blind spots? New segments? | Can we move faster? Do we have the resources? | Prioritizes go-to-market tactics |
| **Threats** | What could disrupt our advantage? Competitor moves? Substitutes? | How do we defend? Mitigate before launch? | Risk identification, contingency planning |
