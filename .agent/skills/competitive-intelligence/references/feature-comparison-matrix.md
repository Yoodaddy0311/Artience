## Scoring Guide

| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **+2** | Major competitive advantage (defensible 12+ months) | Highlight in marketing, develop further |
| **+1** | Slight edge but competitor close behind | Monitor quarterly, small improvements OK |
| **0** | Feature parity (expected in category) | Table-stakes, don't market as differentiator |
| **-1** | Slight gap (customer complaint risk) | Plan roadmap item (next 2 quarters) |
| **-2** | Major gap (deal killer for prospects) | Urgent: fix before next campaign or sales season |

## Competitive Response Playbook
