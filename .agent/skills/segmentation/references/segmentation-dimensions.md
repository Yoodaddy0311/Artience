# Segmentation Dimensions

**Core Principle: Segment by Behavior and Intent, Not Just Demographics**

Segmentation divides your customer base into groups with shared characteristics, enabling targeted messaging and personalization. Six core dimensions exist. Use multiple dimensions together for better targeting.

## Segmentation Dimensions Reference

| Dimension | Variables | Data Sources | Best For | Example Segments |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Demographic** | Age, gender, location, income, education, family status | CRM, surveys, public records | Broad targeting, ad placement | "Millennial mothers, $50K+ income, US East" |
| **Firmographic** | Industry, company size, revenue, growth rate, employee count | LinkedIn, B2B databases, public filings | B2B targeting, enterprise deals | "SaaS, 50-200 employees, $5-25M ARR" |
| **Behavioral** | Usage frequency, feature adoption, content consumption, purchase history | Product analytics, email, CRM | Product targeting, retention | "Power users (DAU), feature X adoption >80%" |
| **Psychographic** | Values, beliefs, lifestyle, personality, motivations, risk tolerance | Surveys, content preferences, social | Messaging calibration | "Privacy-conscious, DIY preference, risk-averse" |
| **Technographic** | Tech stack, tool usage, device, OS, adoption rate, integration count | Product, site analytics, tech audits | Feature prioritization, partner dev | "Uses Slack, Figma, vs. Code, <5 integrations" |
| **Intent** | Search keywords, content viewed, event attendance, purchase stage, urgency | Website analytics, keyword research, form data | Buying signals, sales routing | "Visited pricing 3x, demo booked, this week" |

## RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Scoring

Score each customer 1-5 on each dimension:

| Dimension | 5 Stars | 4 Stars | 3 Stars | 2 Stars | 1 Star |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Recency** | <7 days | 8-30 days | 31-90 days | 91-180 days | >6 months |
| **Frequency** | 10+ times/mo | 5-9 times/mo | 2-4 times/mo | 1 time/mo | <1 time/mo |
| **Monetary** | $1000+ | $500-999 | $100-499 | $25-99 | <$25 |

**RFM Segments**:
- **Champions** (5-5-5): Frequent, recent, high-value → VIP retention
- **At Risk** (1-1-1): Inactive, low-spend → Reactivation campaign
- **Loyal** (3-5-5): Regular, valuable → Upsell focus
- **New** (5-3-2): Recent, not yet regular → Onboarding focus
- **Slipping** (2-4-4): Was good, now inactive → Win-back campaign

## Intent Signal Detection

Map keywords/behaviors to buying stage:

| Stage | Keywords | Behaviors | Urgency | Action |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Awareness** | "what is X", "how to", guides | Blog reads, guide downloads | Low | Nurture, educational content |
| **Consideration** | "vs", "comparison", "reviews" | Case study reads, demo watch | Medium | Position vs. competitors |
| **Decision** | "pricing", "demo", "try", buy | Pricing page views, trial signup | High | Sales outreach, urgency |
| **Post-Purchase** | "tutorial", "integration", "API" | Feature adoption, support tickets | Medium | Onboarding, success |

|-------------|----------|------------------|-----------|--------|
| **Power Users** | Feature adoption >80%, DAU | High expansion | Advanced features, API access | Upsell to enterprise |
| **Casual Users** | <20% adoption, weekly use | Medium retention | Core features, tips | Feature education |
| **Investors** | Viewed pricing, scheduled demo, completed 3-step trial | High conversion | ROI, case studies, reference | Sales handoff |
| **Churning** | 30-day inactive, was daily user | Retention focus | What changed?, special offer | Win-back campaign |
| **Support-Heavy** | 5+ support tickets/month | Churn risk | Self-serve resources, training | Proactive education |

## Segmentation Validation Matrix

Before activating a segment, validate it meets these criteria:

| Criteria | Requirement | How to Measure | Pass/Fail |
|----------|------------|----------------|----------|
| **Minimum Size** | 50+ customers (or 5% of base) | Count segment members | ✓ or ✗ |
| **Measurable** | Data-driven, not opinion | Can segment automatically? | ✓ or ✗ |
| **Accessible** | Can identify at decision point | Data available pre-marketing? | ✓ or ✗ |
| **Differentiable** | Distinct from other segments | Different behavior/needs? | ✓ or ✗ |
| **Actionable** | Can personalize for this group | Different messaging/offer? | ✓ or ✗ |

**Only activate segments that pass all five criteria.**
