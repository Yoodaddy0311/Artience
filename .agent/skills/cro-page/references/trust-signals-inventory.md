# Trust Signal Placement & Impact Inventory

**Core: Strategic placement of customer validation signals above fold to reduce perceived risk and increase conversion**

## Trust Signal Decision Matrix

| Signal Type | Placement | Impact Level | Example Implementation | Benchmark Lift |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Customer Logos | Hero + Footer | High | 3-5 recognizable brands, grayscale | +8-15% |
| Testimonials | Below CTA | High | 3 quotes, name/title/photo, specific metric | +5-12% |
| Review Count | Near CTA | Medium | "Rated 4.8★ (2,847 reviews)" | +3-7% |
| Security Badges | Payment/footer | High | SSL, PayPal, verified badges (not generic) | +2-4% |
| Case Studies | Below fold | Medium | 1-2 metrics, customer avatar match | +4-9% |
| Money-Back Guarantee | CTA area | High | "30-day guarantee or 100% refund" | +3-6% |
| Social Proof Numbers | Hero section | Medium | "Trusted by 50K+ companies" (if true) | +2-5% |

## Above-Fold Trust Signal Hierarchy

**Implement in this priority order:**

1. **Primary** (Critical if B2B or high-price): Customer logos (top 3-5 brands)
2. **Secondary** (Critical if service/SaaS): Star rating + review count
3. **Tertiary** (Optional if space): Single powerful testimonial quote
4. **Verification** (Always): Security badge (SSL minimum, PayPal/Stripe ideal)

## Trust Signal Audit Checklist

- [ ] Logo section includes only recognizable, relevant brands (remove weak logos)
- [ ] Testimonials include customer name, job title, company name, face photo
- [ ] Review count is prominent (e.g., "4.8 stars from 2,847 verified buyers")
- [ ] Security badges are genuine (not generic "Secure" graphics)
- [ ] Guarantee statement is specific with timeframe ("30-day" not "money-back")
- [ ] All trust signals above or on first scroll (mobile)
- [ ] Social proof numbers are recent and verified (update quarterly)
- [ ] Competitor logos removed (confusing trust attribution)
- [ ] No more than 5 customer logos (overcrowding reduces impact)
